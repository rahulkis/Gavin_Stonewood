== WHAT’S INCLUDED IN OUR FREE ONE CLICK UPSELL FUNNEL WORDPRESS PLUGIN ==

**1) Unlimited Funnels with an Unlimited Number of Offers**
With the WooCommerce Upsell Plugin, you can create unlimited sales funnels with any number of Upsell and Cross-Sell Offers. In simple words, you can show your customers multiple post-purchase offers in a single sales funnel which increases the impulse buys, Average Order Value, and revenue of your WooCommerce store.

**2) Add the Shipping Price on COD**
You may now set the Shipping price to Cash on Delivery at checkout with this new feature of the WooCommerce one-click upsell plugin. At the upsell checkout, providing your consumers with a thorough accounting of every dollar spent could enhance AOV and sales.


**3) Reporting Feature for Funnel Tracking**
With the One Click Upsell plugin, you get a complete report of every single funnel. This report includes the number of times every single sales funnel has been triggered. Accepted and rejected offers of each funnel, their conversion rate, total sales, etc. This helps you comprehend what funnels interest your customers more and what do not. Also, you can track the Upsells using Google Analytics and Facebook Pixel.

**4) Independent Global Funnel**
You can now create a global funnel that can be triggered always independently of any target products. You can use this feature if you want to show an upsell offer to your customers every time they purchase in your WooCommerce store.

**5) Smart Offer Upgrade**
Want to offer an upgrade on the existing purchase to your customers? The Smart Offer Upgrade feature replaces the existing product (customer is buying) with the offer product as soon as they accept the upsell offer.

**6) Exclusive Offer Feature**
This feature will make the Funnel Offers exclusive to the customers, meaning it will be shown to customers only once based on the order email.

**7) Sandbox Mode**
In the Sandbox mode, the upsell sales funnel triggers only for the admin and not for Live Customers. This enables store owners to freely view, test, and customize their Upsell funnel offers before making them live.

**8) Page Builder Support to Build Responsive Offer Pages**
The One-Click Upsell Funnel plugin supports most of the page builders available on WordPress. This makes it easy for merchants to create and customize their offer pages without coding knowledge.

**9) Shortcodes to Build Useful Offer Page Elements**
This WordPress upsell plugin provides various shortcodes to create different offer page elements. The plugin offers shortcodes for Buy Now, No Thanks, Product Title, Description, Short Description, Image, Price, Variations, Offer Quantity, and Urgency Timer.

**10) Ability to Simplify The Buying Process**
As the name suggests, it is one click upsell, which means the customers can purchase the upsell product in one click checkout without re-entering the payment details again. This simplifies the buying process of the customers and also engages the customer at your store which lifts the customer success & reduces your churn rate.
